# India_CPI_Inflation
## Overview																				
In India, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is used to measure inflation, and it involves a fixed basket of goods and services. This basket is comprehensive and includes a wide array of items that an average Indian consumer uses. These items are not limited to just food and clothing but extend to transportation, medical care, electricity, education, and almost every other category that involves expenditure of money. The CPI is calculated by comparing the general price level in the markets during a particular time period with a base year. The items in the CPI basket are classified across various categories like food and beverages, clothing, housing, fuel and light, and recreation, among others.																				

## Problem Statement																				
																				
You are working with the National Statistical Office which is equipped to release inflation numbers in India. As an analyst, you are provided with CPI data and are equipped find out insights from the data. Your senior wants you to find key trends and deep dive into the data to answer the following questions -   																				

1. Based on the latest month’s data, identify the contribution of different sectors (food, energy, transportation, education, etc.) towards the CPI basket																				
Which sector has the highest weightage towards CPI calculation 																				
 																				
2. A trend of Y-o-Y increase in CPI (rural + urban) inflation starting 2017 for the entire basket of products																				
Create a bar graph depicting the growth rate Y-o-Y and identify the year with highest inflation rate  																				
																				
3. With India's retail inflation reaching a 3-month high of 5.55% in November 2023, largely due to a sharp rise in food prices. Analyze which specific food items have contributed the most to this increase at month-on-month basis for 12 months ending May’2023   																				
Investigate trends in the prices of vegetables, fruits, and pulses, (broader food bucket) and compare month-on-month changes 																				
Identify the absolute changes in prices over 12 months and identify the biggest contributor towards inflation																				
																				
4. Investigate how the onset and progression of the COVID-19 pandemic affected inflation rates in India. Analyze the correlation between key pandemic milestones (e.g., lockdowns, vaccination drives) and changes in the consumer price index, particularly focusing on sectors like healthcare, food, and essential services.																				
																				
5. Investigate how major global economic events (like oil price fluctuations, international trade policies during the pandemic) have influenced India's inflation. This can include an analysis of imported goods and their price trends. 																				
																				
For the purpose of this analysis, focus only on the oil price fluctuations for years 2021 to 2023 																				
Identify trends in oil price change with change in inflation – identify sector that strongly correlates with fluctuations in oil price
